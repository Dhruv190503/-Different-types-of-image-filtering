This project demonstrates various image preprocessing and filtering techniques in Python, implemented as part of a mini-project. The methods covered include:

Image Transformations:

Log Transformation
Gamma Transformation
Binarization
Negative Image Creation
Filtering Techniques:

Averaging
Mean Filtering
Gaussian Filtering
Median Filtering
Each method is applied to demonstrate its effect on image quality, smoothing, and noise reduction. This repository provides code examples for each technique, making it a valuable resource for understanding image preprocessing concepts and their practical applications in Python.
